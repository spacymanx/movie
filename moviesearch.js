// My objective is to:
// 1. Use JavaScript to capture user input and send it to my backend (or call the TMDB API directly).
// 2. Make request to TMDB to Search for movies by their original, translated and alternative titles.
// 3. After retrieving a movieâ€™s ID, use the Similar Movies API to get related movies.
// 4. For each of the 10 movies suggested, whip up a chunk of HTML that presents a movie card
// 5. Inject those movie cards into our search_wrap

// I want my page to do certain things AFTER my html has loaded
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // this function below will only run AFTER my HTML and CSS has been understood by the browser.
